# Optical Data Transfer using Laser and Photodiode

## Features
- Wireless data transfer system using a LASER, photodiode, and ESP8266 microcontrollers
- Encoded string messages into binary for light-based data transmission
- It can transmit binary data using Laser blinks for '1' and off-state for '0'
- A receiver system with a photodiode to detect light pulses and send signals to ESP8266
- Decodes received binary signals and reconstructed the original message without any losses
